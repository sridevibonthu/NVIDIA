Self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position <i>i</i> can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than <i>i</i>. In other words, masked multi-head attention is applied to prevent future words to be part of the attention."
