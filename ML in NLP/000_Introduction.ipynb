    "In this lab, you will explore the concept of *attention*, and look at how it powers the Transformer architecture, which was introduced in the [\"Attention is All You Need!\"(Vaswani et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper. The Transformer architecture is the precursor to large-scale language models such as [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and [Megatron](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/language-modeling-using-megatron-a100-gpu/), which have provided a leap in accuracy for natural language processing (NLP) tasks and brought high-quality language-based services within the reach of companies across many industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific NLP task we'll focus on in this section is *neural machine translation (NMT)*.  We'll step through the fundamentals of the Transformer architecture, and use it to translate English sentences into German sentences. \n",
