    "    For the two class projects, you'll use datasets drawn from the [NCBI-disease corpus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Dogan/DISEASE/), which consists of 793 annotated PubMed abstracts. You'll explore the details of these datasets, to gain insight into how you can adapt _your own datasets_ to these types of applications.<br>\n",
